PSF Photometry algorith propose:
 -> Identify the stars, using photutils (maybe)
 -> Estimate the FWHM and RMS of a Gaussian (or Lorentzian) fitting of the stars
 -> Identify the n brighests stars, isolated from others in a box of side l
 -> Create the PSF by combining these images
 -> Perform the PSF fitting
